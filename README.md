# Lab1.1:
`Lab1.1` consists of multiple functions performing different operations on an array. 

It includes:

- Creating an array with random values.
- Printing the array to display its contents.
- Finding the maximum element in the array.
- Computing the sum of elements before the last negative number.
- Modifying the array by replacing elements in a given range with zero and rearranging it.

<h3>Project Structure Description</h3>

This project is divided into three files to maintain a modular structure:

`lab1.1.cpp` → Contains the main() function.

`mod_lab11.h` → The header file that declares function prototypes.

`func1.1.cpp` → Implements all the functions declared in the header.
